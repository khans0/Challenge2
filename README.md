## �� DESCRIPTION
​
### �� What is it about?

This project is about creating a portfolio to showcase the skills I have learnt to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.

The motivation for this project was to have a ready built webpage
that will allow me to update it as the course progresses.
​
## �� USAGE
​
[**>> Visit my portfolio website <<**](https://github.com/khans0/My-Portfolio)

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
​
It's done when:
​
- [✅]When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
- [✅]When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- [✅]When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
- [✅]When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- [✅]When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
- [✅]When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
